This program asks for user input and calculates how much the bill is split into.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Welcome greeting print function
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")

#Requesting user input for total open.
total_bill = input("What is the total bill?")

#Requesting user input for tip %
tip = input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?")

#Requesting user input for how many people to split the bill for.
split = input("How many people to split the bill?")

#tip has to be converted from string to int to make the calculations.
tip = (int(tip) * 0.01) + 1

#type converstion for total_ill and split to calculate the tip
bill_tip = (float(total_bill) / int(split)) * tip

#Rounding to 2 decimals.
bill_tip = round(bill_tip, 2)

#print statement letting user know how much each user should pay.
print(f"Each person should pay: ${bill_tip}")
